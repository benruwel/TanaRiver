                        <p> <strong>Roads and Public Works </strong></p>
                        <p>Tana River County has a total of 1,108 Km of classified road network. Out of this, about 55 percent
                            of the total road network is in good condition. <br>
                            Most of the roads are intercepted by seasonal rivers (commonly known as laghas , which make them
                            impassable during the rainy seasons. Although the county produces most of the marketed mango fruits
                            in major towns in the Coast region, most of the produce ends up rotting in farms due to poor road
                            network.
                            The county government therefore, has to allocate adequate resources for scaling up road improvement
                            and opening up new roads.
